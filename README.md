# Binary-Search-Tree

Binary Search Tree TOP Capstone: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees


This project is a javascript implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. This was completed as part of my self study following The Odin Project syllabus, along the Full Stack Javascript path. BSTs are an ordered structure built from Nodes, starting from a Root Node.

A Node in a BST has the following properties:

- data: the value of a node (an integer value in this implementation)

- left: points to the left Node which contains a value less than its Root

- right: points to the right Node which contains a value greater than its Root

A Node is considered a Leaf Node if it has no children - i.e. if node.left == node.right == null


This project consists of the following modules:

Classes:

- bstClass.js
- nodeClass.js

Merge Sort:

- merge.js
- mergeSort.js

Misc:

- prettyPrint.js

Driver:

- index.js


**To run the project:**

1. Clone this repository

2. Make sure that node is installed on your machine. If it is not, follow this guide (jump to the section which fits your specs): https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-installing-node-js

3. Run `node index.js` in your terminal after navigating to the `Binary-Search-Tree` (parent) directory of this project.
